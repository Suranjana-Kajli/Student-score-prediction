# Student-score-prediction
To predict scores of students based on various features.
I separated the excel file columns with the help of delimiters.
I merged the two datasets together.
Analysed the data.
There were no null values present in the dataset.
Found out the Pearson's correlation coefficient using a heatmap.
Tried to figure out the most important features.
used one-hot encoding for categorical data.
Split the data into train and test set.
Used regression models such as Linear Regression', 'ElasticNet Regression, 'Random Forest', 'Extra Trees', 'SVM', 'Gradient Boosted'.
Found out that the best model was Random Forest.
